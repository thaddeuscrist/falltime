      <p>GOLD of a ripe oat straw, gold of a southwest moon,</p>
      <p>Canada thistle blue and flimmering larkspur blue,</p>
      <p>Tomatoes shining in the October sun with red hearts,</p>
      <p>Shining five and six in a row on a wooden fence,</p>
      <p>Why do you keep wishes on your faces all day long,</p>
      <p>Wishes like women with half-forgotten lovers going to new cities?</p>
      <p>What is there for you in the birds, the birds, the birds, crying down on the north wind in September, acres of birds spotting the air going south?</p>
      <p>Is there something finished? And some new beginning on the way?</p>
